title: "Random Sentence Generator using JavaScript"

Using JavaScript and some minimal HTML, I built a simple random sentence generator. The program itself used 3 arrays, one containing nouns, verbs, and adjectives. From there it pulled a random noun, verb or adjective and inserted them into a pre-structured sentence for every occurance in the sentence.
